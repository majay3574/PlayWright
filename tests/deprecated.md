In a browser environment, the global variable name has special meaning because it's a property of the window object. This often causes confusion when developers try to create their own global variable named name. The variable may get coerced into a string or cause other unexpected behavior.

Example Explanation
Using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):

javascript
Copy code
!(function () {
    let name = 'Mark';
    name = 5;
    console.log(name);
})();
In this example, the variable name is declared and assigned within the scope of the IIFE using let. This creates a local variable name within the function's scope, independent of the global name. As a result, the code runs without issues, and the output is 5.

Global Variable Declaration:

javascript
Copy code
let name = 'Mark';
name = 5;
console.log(name);
Here, the variable name is declared globally using let. Despite being a global variable, let declarations are block-scoped and do not attach to the window object. Therefore, this code also runs without issues, and the output is 5.

The Confusion with name
The confusion usually arises when a global variable named name is created without let, const, or var. For example:

javascript
Copy code
name = 'Mark';
console.log(name); // 'Mark'
In this case, name refers to the global window.name property. Assigning a value to name modifies the window.name property, which is always a string. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

Checker Behavior
The checker you're using might not handle assignments to name correctly if it follows a let name declaration. This could be because it doesn't properly account for the scope of name and mistakenly treats it as the global window.name property.
